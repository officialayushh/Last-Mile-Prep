        What is Inheritance?
        => The javascript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already exisitng classes.
        It provides ton the child flexibility to the child classs to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

        => The javascript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class.
        It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behaviour of its parent class.
