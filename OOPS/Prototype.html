        Q.1. What is prototype and why we need of us ?
        => In a prototype-based approach,all the objects share the same function.This ignores the
        requirement of creating a new copy of function for each object.Thus,the functions are loaded 
        once into the memory.

        Javascript is a prototype-based language that facilitates the objects to acquire 
        properties and features from one another.Here,each object contains a prototype object
        Used:-
        In Js, whenever a function is created the prototype property is added to that function automatically
        This property is a prototype object that holds a constructor property.

        Q.2. Prototype Chaining:-
        Each object contains a prototype object that acquires properties and methods from it
        Again an object's prototype object may contain a prototype object that also acquires properties and methods,and so on.
        It can be seen as prototype chaining.

        Syntax:
        ClassName.prototype.methodName
    -->
    <script>
        function Employee(fname,lname){
            this.fname = fname;
            this.lname = lname;
        }
        // Employee.prototype.fullName = function(){
        //     return this.fname+" "+this.lname;
        // }
        // Suppose i want to add property there:-
        Employee.prototype.company = "Javascript";
        var emp1 = new Employee("Ayush","Saraswat");
        var emp2 = new Employee("Shivam","Kumar");
        // document.writeln(emp1.fullName() + "<br>");
        // document.writeln(emp2.fullName() + "<br>");
        document.writeln(emp1.fname+" "+emp1.lname+" "+emp1.company+"<br>");
        document.writeln(emp2.fname+" "+emp2.lname+" "+emp2.company+"<br>");
    </script>
